This is a repository for my medical reference files. Probably the most referenced, by myself and others, is the *Antibiotic Dosing in Renal Failure* or *ABX_Dosing.pdf*. Several of the older references are somewhat outdated, but still useful. I intend to keep the renal failure dosing always updated, and when given the opportunity, update the older files and add new ones.
