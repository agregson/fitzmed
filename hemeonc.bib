  abstract = {Pulmonary nodules and nodular infiltrates occur frequently during treatment of hematologic malignancies and after hematopoietic cell transplantation. In patients not receiving active immunosuppressive therapy, the most likely culprits are primary lung cancer, chronic infectious or inactive granulomata, or even the underlying hematologic disease itself (especially in patients with lymphoma). In patients receiving active therapy or who are otherwise highly immunosuppressed, there is a wider spectrum of etiologies with infection being most likely, especially by bacteria and fungi. Characterization of the pulmonary lesion by high-resolution CT imaging is a crucial first diagnostic step. Other noninvasive tests can often be useful, but invasive testing by bronchoscopic evaluation or acquisition of tissue by one of several biopsy techniques should be performed for those at risk for malignancy or invasive infection unless contraindicated. The choice of the optimal biopsy technique should be individualized, guided by location of the lesion, suspected etiology, skill and experience of the diagnostic team, procedural risk of complications, and patient status. Although presumptive therapy targeting the most likely etiology is justified in patients suspected of serious infection while evaluation proceeds, a structured evaluation to determine the specific etiology is recommended. Interdisciplinary teamwork is highly desirable to optimize diagnosis and therapy.},

	has been approved for prophylaxis in neutropenic patients and stem
	cell transplantation (SCT) recipients. However, routine use of a
	prophylactic drug may yield different results than those from clinical
	trials. We collected data on the efficacy, safety, breakthrough infections,
	and antimicrobial resistance associated with standard long-term posaconazole
	prophylaxis in adult allogeneic SCT recipients at the UCLA Medical
	Center. Oral posaconazole (200 mg 3 times daily) was started on day
	1 after SCT and continued until day 100. After day 100, posaconazole
	was continued in patients who still required corticosteroids for
	prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease. From January
	2007 through December 2008, 106 consecutive patients received prophylactic
	posaconazole. Breakthrough invasive fungal infections on posaconazole
	occurred in 8 patients (7.5\%) within 6 months after SCT; 3 additional
	patients developed invasive fungal infection after discontinuation
	of prophylactic posaconazole. The infective organisms were Candida
	(8 cases), Aspergillus (2 cases), and Aspergillus plus Coccidioides
	immitis (1 case). There were no Zygomycetes infections. Only 2 (both
	Candida glabrata) of 9 infecting isolates tested were resistant to
	posaconazole (minimal inhibitory concentration >1 Î¼g/mL). Mortality
	from invasive fungal infection occurred in 4 patients (3.7\%). Except
	for nausea in 9 patients, no clinical adverse event or laboratory
	abnormality could be attributed to posaconazole. Mean peak and trough
	plasma posaconazole concentrations were relatively low (<400 ng/mL)
	in neutropenic patients with oral mucositis and other factors possibly
	affecting optimal absorption of posaconazole. These results demonstrate
	that standard long-term oral posaconazole prophylaxis after allogeneic
	SCT is safe and associated with few invasive mold infections. However,
	breakthrough infections caused by posaconazole-susceptible organisms
	(frequently Candida) may occur at currently recommended prophylactic
	doses. Thus, strategies to improve posaconazole exposure, including
	the use of higher doses, administration with an acidic beverage,
	and restriction of proton pump inhibitors, need to be considered
	when using prophylactic posaconazole.},

	cepacia, on the survival after lung transplantation in patients with
	cystic fibrosis (CF) remains controversial. METHODS: To determine
	the impact of panresistant bacteria in CF patients on survival after
	lung transplantation a retrospective multicenter study was performed.
	All lung transplant recipients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of
	CF, at the University of Toronto (n = 53) and Duke University (n
	= 50), were included. Patients were included in the panresistant
	group if at least one specimen isolated from their respiratory secretions
	grew bacteria resistant or intermediate to all classes of antibiotics
	tested. Patients with sensitive or resistant B cepacia were excluded
	because of its adverse impact upon post-transplant survival. RESULTS:
	Forty-five of 103 (43.7%) patients harbored panresistant bacteria
	(43 had Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 had Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,
	and 1 had Achromobacter xylosoxidans). According to log-rank test,
	there was decreased survival in patients with panresistant bacteria
	compared to patients with sensitive bacteria (survival: 91.1 +/-
	4.2% vs 98.3 +/- 1.7% at 3 months; 88.6 +/- 4.8% vs 96.6 +/- 2.4%
	at 1 year; 63.2 +/- 8.6% vs 90.7 +/- 4.0% at 3 years; 58.3 +/- 9.2%
	vs 85.6 +/- 5.2% at 5 years; p = 0.016). The results did not differ
	significantly between the two centers. Both groups had similar or
	better survival than CF patients as reported by the United Network
	of Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry (1-year, 86.0%; 3 years, 65.4%;
	5 years, 49.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CF harboring panresistant
	bacteria have slightly decreased survival, but their survival is
	comparable to the results published by the UNOS registry.},
