# Pulmonary Infiltrates/Nodules

See [@Wingard2012]

Apparently HRCT gives diagnosis of pneumonia about four days prior to chest x-ray.
Infectious causes much less likely in those not receiving chemotherapy, newly diagnosed patients and those post-treatment or post-transplant without GVHD. 
In newly diagnosed AML pulmonary infiltrates are generally not infectious and pre-treatment aspergillus is rare.
Those patients undergoing chemotherapy or otherwise immunocompromised, infections are usually the cause of nodular lesions and bacteria are the leading cause. 
Diagnostic yields are highest when performed at initial presentation, i.e., bronchoscopy within 24 hours of presentation.
Realize that patients may clinically, and most certainly radiographically, deteriorate during early therapy (first week or two) but that this clinical deterioration may be accompanied by microbiologic improvement. 
If GM was positive initially, serial monitoring may be helpful in determining response. 

## Diffuse Pulmonary Infiltrates (Infectious)
1. viral disease
2. *P. jiroveci*
3. Legionella
4. Mycoplasma

## Nodular Pulmonary Infiltrates (Infectious)
Mass lesions larger than 3cm more likely to be malignant, while those smaller than 1cm are generally not malignant.
PET not sensitive enough for nodules < 1cm. 
Realize that halo sign is *not* specific for aspergillus. 
Likewise, the "reverse halo" is not specific for mucor.

1. Bacterial agents 
    - i.e., gram positive and negative organisms
    - earlier after SCT
2. Nocardia
    - later after SCT
3. Aspergillus 
    - generally after at least two weeks of profound neutropenia
    - about 1/2 nodules due to fungus and 80% of those due to aspergillus
    - particularly in AML
    - >90% with nodule >1cm, 80% with multiple nodules, 60% bilateral, 60% with halo sign, 30% consolidation
    - usually peripheral locations
5. *P. jiroveci*
6. other molds
    - at least one study found pleural effusion more likely with mucor than with aspergillus
3. Toxoplasma
4. Strongyloides
7. chronic, inactive granulomata (Mtb, endemic/dimorphic fungi)
8. considered mixed infections as well.

# Serum Tests for Aspergillus
Need to place in references specific for this, all taken from [@Wingard2012].

## Galactomanin (GM)

Sensitivity and specificity are >80% when used serially, 2x/week in those at risk of disease. 
Not so good when used once when have findings on radiography.
Can be positive for penicillium and endemic fungi infections.
Use of fungal prophylaxis attenuates usefulness of test. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage GM may increase yield over cultures alone.

## $\beta$ Glucan
As sensitive but not specific for aspergillus as many fungi release $\beta$ glucan including candida, fusarium, trichosporon and pneumocystis. 

# Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder

Risk factors include:
1. ATG induction
2. Cord blood transplant
3. Unmatched donor/recipient transplants 
4. GVHD
5. T cell depleted stem cell transplants

Increasing number of risk factors increases risk. Most likely to see 6--12 months post-transplant.
